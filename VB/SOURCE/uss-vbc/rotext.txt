Ok, here is some stuff you can do with RoText.vbx

1. Make text spin on a from counter-clockwise...

Put a RoText box on your form
Put a Timer on your form
Go into the properties of the timer and have Timer1.Interval = 1
Have Timer1.Enabled = True if you want it to start when you load the form
Have Timer1.Enabled = False if you want it to start when you click a button.

In Timer1 put this code:
RoText1.Angle = RoText1.Angle + 2 ' this tells how many degrees to spin the
Text
the bigger the number, the faster it spins...it's a good idea to use an even
number...

' if you run the program now, it will just have the Text spin forever...There
are a couple ways to have it stop.

   A. make a command button with this code:
       Timer1.Enabled = False
       Timer1.Interval = 0

   B. To make it stop after a certain number of spins, put this in Timer1:
        RoText1.Angle = RoText1.Angle + 2
        If RoText1.Angle = x * 360 Then Timer1.Enabled = False &
Timer1.Interval = 0
       ' x = the number of complete spins...

2. To have the Text spin clock-wise instead of counter-clockwise like normal:
    RoText1.Angle = RoText1. Angle + (-2)

To have the Text spin in one direction, then spin in the other direction...
  RoText1.Angle = RoText1.Angle + 2
  If RoText1.Angle = x * 360 Then 
  Timer1.Enabled = False 
  Timer1.Interval = 0
  Timer2.Enabled = True
  Timer2.Interval = 1
  End if
  
In the second timer, just put the clockwise spin code...

You can do the same thing with the colors, size, etc...all just by using a
Timer...

If you need any more help, just ask...   L8er,
